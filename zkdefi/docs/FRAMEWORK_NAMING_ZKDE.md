# Framework Naming: zkDE + GATE

**Why zkDE + GATE:** zkDE is the *engine* (proof-gated, deterministic verification infrastructure); GATE is the *standard* for agents in that engine. One sentence for judges/talks: *"GATE is the standard for the zkDE engine — execute only when proven; delegate without exposing."*

**Primary pairing:**
- **zkDE** | **Zero-Knowledge Deterministic Engine** — the infrastructure where execution is proof-gated and verification is deterministic.
- **GATE** | **Governed Autonomous Trustless Execution** — the standard that defines how agents operate in that engine.

They work well together: Zero-Knowledge Deterministic Engine (zkDE) + GATE (Governed Autonomous Trustless Execution).

You already own **zkde.fi** (the app). Using **zkDE** as the framework name keeps the brand and is literally true: zero-knowledge + deterministic + execution infrastructure.

## What the framework actually does

- **Gates execution** on a proof (no proof -> no execution). Verification is **deterministic** (valid or not).
- Lets you **delegate** (session keys); the delegate can only execute with a valid proof.
- Uses **zero-knowledge** proofs so you can verify (constraints, compliance) without revealing (amounts, strategy, model outputs).
- Runs on **Starknet** (decentralized L2, Integrity, AA). Prover can be **distributed** (self-hosted or shared).

So: **execution** is the object being gated; **zero-knowledge** is the privacy/verification layer; **delegated** is the agent/session-key model; **deterministic** describes verification; **engine** describes the infrastructure.

## zkDE = Zero-Knowledge Deterministic Engine

- **Engine** emphasizes infrastructure: prover (Stone), fact registry (Integrity), contracts, session-key and intent primitives.
- "We build on the zkDE engine" or "zkDE Engine by Obsqra Labs."
- The engine provides: proof generation, verification, fact registry integration, session key management.

## GATE = Governed Autonomous Trustless Execution

The standard for agents operating in the zkDE engine:

- **Governed** — Execution governed by proof; only proceeds when verified.
- **Autonomous** — Agents act on your behalf via session keys.
- **Trustless** — No trust required; verification is cryptographic.
- **Execution** — The actual on-chain action (deposit, withdraw, rebalance).

GATE defines: interfaces, session key format, intent commitments, proof formats, verification flows.

## Starknet alignment

- **Execution** = what Starknet does (L2 execution); you're adding "proof-gated" and "delegated" on top.
- **Delegated** = account abstraction, session keys, agents — core Starknet primitives.
- **Zero-knowledge** = STARKs, Integrity, native verification. Fits "ZK execution" and "verifiable AI."
- **Decentralized** = L2, shared fact registry, no single prover required.

## Privacy angles

1. **Verifiable privacy** — Hide (intent, amounts, strategy) and prove (constraints, compliance). "Private AND verifiable."
2. **Delegation without exposure** — Session keys let an agent act without using your main key every time.
3. **Proof-gated as minimal disclosure** — Chain only sees "proof valid" and what you choose to expose.
4. **Intent-hiding until execution** — Intent hidden until proof verified and action runs. MEV/intent protection.
5. **Selective disclosure** — Prove statements without revealing full history.

## How zkDE and GATE work together

- **zkDE (Zero-Knowledge Deterministic Engine)** = the infrastructure: prover, fact registry, verification, session key primitives.
- **GATE (Governed Autonomous Trustless Execution)** = the standard: interfaces, proof formats, session key structures, verification flows.

So: "GATE is the standard for zkDE-compatible agents" or "We implement GATE on the zkDE engine."

## One-liners

- **Framework:** "zkDE (Zero-Knowledge Deterministic Engine): execute only when proven; delegate without exposing."
- **Standard:** "GATE (Governed Autonomous Trustless Execution): the agent standard for the zkDE engine."
- **Starknet:** "zkDE is infrastructure for proof-gated, delegated execution on Starknet — ZK verification, session keys, and trustless AI."
- **Privacy:** "zkDE gives you verifiable privacy: hide intent and strategy, prove compliance and constraints."
