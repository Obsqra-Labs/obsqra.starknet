                    VK MISMATCH FIX - DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
=============================================================================

TECHNICAL FIX: ✅ 100% COMPLETE

ROOT CAUSE:
  - One verifier used for both deposit & withdrawal
  - But they have different verification keys!
  - Withdrawal proof → deposit verifier = "Wrong Glv&FakeGLV result"

SOLUTION:
  - Updated contract to use TWO verifiers
  - Generated withdrawal verifier with correct VK
  - Both artifacts built and ready

ARTIFACTS LOCATION:
  Withdrawal Verifier:
    circuits/contracts/src/garaga_verifier_withdraw/target/dev/
      - garaga_verifier_withdraw_Groth16VerifierBN254.contract_class.json
      - garaga_verifier_withdraw_Groth16VerifierBN254.compiled_contract_class.json
    
  ConfidentialTransfer:
    contracts/target/dev/
      - zkdefi_contracts_ConfidentialTransfer.contract_class.json
      - zkdefi_contracts_ConfidentialTransfer.compiled_contract_class.json

DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED:
  ⚠️ RPC v0.7.1 vs v0.10.0 incompatibility blocks automated deployment
  ✅ Manual deployment via Voyager/Starkscan works

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
  1. Go to https://voyager.online/
  2. Upload withdrawal verifier artifacts → Deploy → Save address
  3. Upload ConfidentialTransfer artifacts → Deploy with constructor:
       - garaga_verifier_deposit: 0x06d0cb7a48b48c5b6ca70f856d249caccea90f506ad7596a6838502fe3aa6d37
       - garaga_verifier_withdraw: <from step 2>
       - token: 0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d
       - admin: 0x05fe812551bec726f1bf5026d5fb88f06ed411a753fb4468f9e19ebf8ced1b3d
  4. Update .env files with new ConfidentialTransfer address
  5. Restart backend & frontend
  6. Test!

EXPECTED RESULTS:
  ✅ Deposits work (already working)
  ✅ Withdrawals work (after deployment)
