# Why it matters

## The problem

DeFi today forces a choice:

- **Full transparency** — Everyone can see your positions, sizes, timing, and counterparties. That exposes you to front-running, copy-trading, and loss of edge.
- **Opaque custody** — You hand over control to a custodian or fund. You get privacy but lose verifiability: you must trust that they followed the rules.

We want **privacy-preserving execution that is verifiable**. You keep control; the system proves that it followed your constraints without revealing the details.

## Our approach

**zkde.fi** gives you:

1. **Verifiable execution** — Every action is proof-gated. The chain only accepts transactions that come with a valid proof (e.g. that your allocation stayed within limits). No proof, no execution.
2. **Privacy** — Intent is hidden until execution. Balances can be confidential (commitment-based). You can prove specific statements (compliance, eligibility) without exposing your full history.
3. **You stay in control** — You set constraints and delegate via session keys. The agent operates within those limits; you can revoke or tighten them anytime.

Result: autonomous, privacy-preserving DeFi that stays auditable and trustless.
