🚀 We just achieved something I've been building toward for months:

A full zkML stack with a native Stone prover using Integrity's on-chain verifier.

6/6 E2E tests passing ✅
- Model Registry deployed
- Proof generation operational  
- On-chain verification working
- 100% test pass rate

This isn't the old starknet.obsqra.fi sandbox. This is production-ready zkML infrastructure.

Built on the timeline I committed to on obsqra.fi. 

What's next: Opening it up so builders can use it.

🧵 1/ Thread: We just hit a major milestone

Built a full zkML stack with:
• Native Stone prover (self-hosted)
• Integrity's on-chain verifier
• Model Registry for provenance
• End-to-end proof pipeline

6/6 tests passing. Production-ready.

This moves us from sandbox (starknet.obsqra.fi) to real infrastructure.

A year ago I committed to building zkML infrastructure on obsqra.fi.

Today: 6/6 E2E tests passing on a full zkML stack.

Native Stone prover ✅
Integrity on-chain verifier ✅  
Model Registry ✅
Proof generation ✅

This is what I set out to build. It works.

Next: Let builders use it.

🎯 Milestone: Full zkML stack operational

Native Stone prover + Integrity's on-chain verifier
6/6 E2E tests passing
Production-ready infrastructure

This isn't the sandbox. This is the real thing.

Built on timeline. Delivered.
