# Obsqra.starknet Frontend

Next.js frontend for the Obsqra.starknet MVP/POC.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Features

- Starknet wallet connection
- MIST.cash privacy integration

## Privacy
The current build does not include a privacy SDK. The wallet kit (`obsqra.kit`) is wallet-only; plug in a privacy layer separately if needed.
