# Social Content Strategy - zkML Achievement

**Date**: January 27, 2026  
**Goal**: Communicate the full zkML stack achievement and build awareness

---

## Phase 1: Initial Claim (This Week)

### Tweet 1: Screenshot + Achievement Announcement

**Tweet Text**:
```
🚀 We just achieved something I've been building toward for months:

A full zkML stack with a native Stone prover using Integrity's on-chain verifier.

6/6 E2E tests passing ✅
- Model Registry deployed
- Proof generation operational  
- On-chain verification working
- 100% test pass rate

This isn't the old starknet.obsqra.fi sandbox. This is production-ready zkML infrastructure.

Built on the timeline I committed to on obsqra.fi. 

What's next: Opening it up so builders can use it.

#zkML #Starknet #Cairo #ZeroKnowledge
```

**Alternative (More Technical)**:
```
🧵 1/ Thread: We just hit a major milestone

Built a full zkML stack with:
• Native Stone prover (self-hosted)
• Integrity's on-chain verifier
• Model Registry for provenance
• End-to-end proof pipeline

6/6 tests passing. Production-ready.

This moves us from sandbox (starknet.obsqra.fi) to real infrastructure.

#zkML #Starknet
```

**Alternative (Founder Voice)**:
```
A year ago I committed to building zkML infrastructure on obsqra.fi.

Today: 6/6 E2E tests passing on a full zkML stack.

Native Stone prover ✅
Integrity on-chain verifier ✅  
Model Registry ✅
Proof generation ✅

This is what I set out to build. It works.

Next: Let builders use it.

## Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive (Week 2-3)

### Tweet Thread: What Makes This Different

**Thread Structure**:
1. **Hook**: "Most zkML projects use cloud provers. We built our own."
2. **The Problem**: Cost, latency, vendor lock-in
3. **Our Solution**: Native Stone prover + Integrity verifier
4. **The Numbers**: 100% cost savings, 2.8s proof generation
5. **What This Enables**: Self-hosted zkML for any builder
6. **Call to Action**: "Want to use it? Let's talk."

### Blog Post: "Building a Native zkML Stack"

**Outline**:
- Introduction: Why we built this
- The Architecture: Stone prover + Integrity verifier
- The Challenges: Dynamic FRI, proof serialization
- The Results: 100% test pass, production-ready
- What's Next: Opening the infrastructure

**Key Sections**:
1. **From Sandbox to Production**
   - starknet.obsqra.fi was a learning exercise
   - This is the real infrastructure
   - Timeline commitment and delivery

2. **Technical Deep Dive**
   - Stone prover integration
   - Integrity verifier setup
   - Model Registry implementation
   - Proof pipeline architecture

3. **Performance & Cost**
   - Proof generation: 2.8s average
   - Cost: $0 vs $0.75/proof (cloud)
   - Success rate: 100%

4. **What This Means**
   - Self-hosted zkML is possible
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Full control over infrastructure
