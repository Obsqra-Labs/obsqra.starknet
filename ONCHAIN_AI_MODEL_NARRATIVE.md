# On-Chain AI Model: Narrative & Positioning Value

**Question**: What does putting our AI risk model on-chain add to our narrative? How does this position us?

---

## Executive Summary

Putting the AI risk model on-chain transforms Obsqra from **"verifiable AI infrastructure"** to **"true on-chain AI"** - a category-defining position that no competitor can match. It shifts the narrative from "we prove AI decisions" to "the AI **is** the contract," creating a defensible moat and institutional-grade trust story.

---

## 1. Current Narrative vs. On-Chain AI Narrative

### Current Narrative (Strong, But Not Unique)

**"We have verifiable AI infrastructure"**
- ✅ Proofs verify AI decisions
- ✅ On-chain verification gates
- ✅ Trustless execution
- ✅ Cryptographic guarantees

**Competitive Position**: Similar to Giza, EZKL, LuminAIR - "we prove ML inference"

### On-Chain AI Narrative (Category-Defining)

**"The AI **is** the contract"**
- ✅ Model logic lives on-chain (not just proven off-chain)
- ✅ Model parameters are transparent and upgradeable
- ✅ No black box - anyone can audit the model
- ✅ Model governance is decentralized
- ✅ AI decisions are **literally** smart contract code

**Competitive Position**: **First-mover** in "on-chain AI" category - no one else has this

---

## 2. What This Adds to Our Narrative

### 2.1 "True On-Chain AI" (Not Just Proven AI)

**Before**: "We prove AI decisions off-chain and verify on-chain"  
**After**: "The AI model **lives** on-chain. It's smart contract code."

**Narrative Shift**:
- From: "Trustless verification of external AI"
- To: "AI as infrastructure - the model is the protocol"

**Why This Matters**:
- **Institutional trust**: "The model is public, auditable, and immutable (unless upgraded via governance)"
- **Regulatory clarity**: "The model logic is on-chain, not a black box"
- **Developer appeal**: "You can read the model code, fork it, build on it"
- **Competitive moat**: "We're not just proving AI - we're **running** AI on-chain"

### 2.2 "Transparent AI Governance"

**Narrative**: "Model upgrades are on-chain governance decisions, not backend deployments"

**What This Enables**:
- **DAO governance**: "DAO votes on model parameter changes"
- **Transparency**: "Every model version is on-chain, every upgrade is a transaction"
- **Audit trail**: "Complete history of model evolution on-chain"
- **Forkability**: "Anyone can fork our model and deploy their own version"

**Positioning**: "We're not just using AI - we're **governing** AI on-chain"

### 2.3 "No Black Box AI"

**Narrative**: "The model logic is public smart contract code. Anyone can audit it, verify it, and understand it."

**What This Enables**:
- **Security audits**: "Model logic can be audited like any smart contract"
- **Academic scrutiny**: "Researchers can analyze the model without NDAs"
- **User trust**: "You can verify the model yourself - no trust required"
- **Regulatory compliance**: "Model is transparent and auditable"

**Positioning**: "We're the only DeFi protocol where the AI model is **public smart contract code**"

### 2.4 "Upgradeable AI Without Centralization"

**Narrative**: "Model parameters are on-chain and upgradeable via governance, not backend deployments"

**What This Enables**:
- **Decentralized upgrades**: "Model upgrades are governance decisions, not admin actions"
- **Version control**: "Every model version is on-chain with full provenance"
- **Rollback capability**: "Can revert to previous model versions if needed"
- **Community ownership**: "DAO controls the model, not a centralized team"

**Positioning**: "We're building **decentralized AI governance** - the model is owned by the protocol"

**Positioning**: "We're not just infrastructure - we're **AI-powered DeFi protocol** with on-chain AI"

### 3.3 vs. Traditional DeFi Protocols

**Their Narrative**: "We use off-chain oracles / AI for decisions"

**Our Narrative (with on-chain model)**: "Our AI model is **on-chain smart contract code**"

**Differentiation**:
- **They**: Trust oracles / external AI
- **We**: Trust smart contract code (the model itself)
- **They**: Opaque decision-making
- **We**: Transparent, auditable model logic
- **They**: Centralized model updates
- **We**: Decentralized model governance

Put the AI risk model **on-chain** as smart contract code.

Not "proven off-chain" - the model **lives** on-chain.
- Transparent ✅
- Upgradeable via governance ✅
- Auditable like any contract ✅

This is what "on-chain AI" means.

#zkML #Starknet #OnChainAI
```

**Thread Format**:
```
🧵 1/ Most zkML projects prove AI off-chain and verify on-chain.

We're doing something different:

The AI model **is** the contract.
